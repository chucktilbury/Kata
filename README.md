# Simple
The Simple programming language.

This is a very simple object-oriented programming language which is written in C++. There is no expectation that this will every be used by anyone. It's just a fun hobby project. 

The language is a synthesis or Python and C. It has the object model of Python but shares a lot of syntax with both C and C++.

General features in no particular order.
* Curly braces to delimit blocks.
* Simplified type system, but is strongly typed with casting.
* Function overloads by parameter type.
* Void type is used.
* Single inheritince only.
* No struct keyword.
* Supports dictionaries and lists natively.
* String is a data type.
* No pointers.
* Managed memory.

First versions will be tree-walking (very slow) interpreter. Later versions will use the LLVM infrastructure for native compilation and linking. Final version will be written in Simple.
