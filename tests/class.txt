    This tests classes. These tests are for correct syntax only. A class has
    the following syntax:

    [private|public]* class symbol ( compound_name+ ) { class_body *}

    The scope operators are optional. The default scope is private. The parens
    are mandatory, but the compound name is optional. The class body is
    optional.
