# Grammars

# All of these grammars are obsolete and here for reference only. See the grammar in the main README.md for the latest official grammar.

These grammars are here as a result of trying to get a parser generator that will correctly generate a parser for this language. Unfortunately its ambiguous. So, a hand-written parser is what's required. To see the official grammar for Simple, look at the README.md in the root directory of this repository.
