# Tests directory

As things are now, these tests are not intended to make semantic sense. They verify that correct syntax is accepted and incorrect syntax is rejected. More tests are always needed. The next thing for this is to grab some random C code and port it to NOP syntax.

Many of these tests are example C programs that were converted to NOP by hand. The originals can be found here: https://www.sanfoundry.com/1000-c-algorithms-problems-programming-examples/#c-graph-algorithms-set-1
